axe
===

A tool for hacking the ENT files on StarMade servers. Currently the tool supports the following 

   * Printing out the almost complete structure of any ent file
   * Modifying (print, set, add, multiply) the credits of playerstate type ents. 
   * Modifying (print, set, add, multiply) _currently already existing_ inventory blocks of playerstate and shops type ents. 

Audience
--------

The tool is intended mainly for scripting and server owners, therefore it will not have any interactive operations at all and all features are inteded to provide _expressibility_ rather than convinience. 

Future other tools can provide operations more suited for end-users.

TODO
----
Planned future features include adding new inventory items to players (if there are free slots in the inventory).
